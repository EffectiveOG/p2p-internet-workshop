			## Module 6: Living on a decentralized network

			1. Recap
			2. Motivation: Smart Environments and IoT
			3. Technologies of Smart Environments
			4. LoRa Workshop

			---

			# Recap

			* Learned about mesh concepts
			* Built WiFi mesh nodes
			* Used IPFS to store and share files
			* Talked about how to plan networks for a community
			* Used tools to measure and evaluate network quality

			---

			# Today

			* Apply our knowledge of WiFi networks to other types of wireless devices
			* Talk about the .highlight[Internet of Things] and .highlight[Smart Environments]
			* Build a .highlight[LoRa node] through which we can send and receive packets over radio

			---

			# Motivation

			* When we think of the internet communication, weâ€™re often thinking of our experience with the World Wide Web
			* However, most new connected devices are *embedded systems* with wireless capabilities
			* An IEEE report estimates *30 billion devices* will be connected to the internet by 2020

			---

			# Smart environments

			* **Internet of Things**: Internet connected devices are becoming part of our daily lives for automation and sensing

			* In some cities they are becoming a part of city infrastructure, some people call these ideas *Smart Cities*

			---

			# Need for network literacy

			Although these technologies can be immensely useful for sensing and automation there are concerns about:

			## Security

			IoT device manufacturers have followed notoriously bad security hygiene. The 2016 Mirai Botnet DDoS attack exploited thousands of vulnerable internet connected CCTV cameras to take down DNS servers

			## Surveillance

			Ubiquitous sensing in our environments raises concern about who has access to sensed data and what they may do with it

			## Resilience

			As we become dependent on internet connected devices we need to ensure we have access to alternatives during failure

			# How do smart environments work?

			---

			**How do smart environments work?**
			## Devices

			* **Sensors** for collecting data from the environment
			* **Transceivers** for sending and receiving wireless information
			* **Microcontrollers** are the brains of the device

			---

			**How do smart environments work?**
			## Gateways

			Connect the device to the rest of the internet

			---

			**How do smart environments work?**
			## Servers

			Servers operated by your device provider or other third-parties manage your smart device's data

			# Wireless technologies

			Smart devices today can use many different wireless technologies

			![wireless-tech](slide-images/wireless-tech.svg)

			---

			# Choice of technologies depends on...

			* Cost
			* Range
			* Power Requirements
			* Data Rate
			* Licensing
			* Coverage
			* Ease of Installation

			---

			# Why LoRa is a promising choice

			* **Cost**: Low Cost; $2 RF transceivers
			* **Range**: Long Range; Advertised up to 25 km; World record: 702 km
			* **Power Requirements**: Very Low Power; Sensor applications ~10 Year life from 2 AA batteries
			* **Data Rate**: Low Data Rate; ~150 bps
			* **Licensing** (900 MHz in Canada): ISM Band; No license requirement!
			* **Coverage**: No LoRa providers; need set up our own gateways
			* **Ease of Installation**: Community is developing and supported hardware is becoming available

			# LoRa decoded

			LoRa can achieve such great distances with such low power because it is not very susceptible to noise. LoRa works remarkably well with low signal strength.

			LoRa uses *Chirp Spread Spectrum Modulation*, ie. the information is encoded in the shifts of increasing or decreasing frequency.

			# Steamlink

			We're using an open source community platform for building, deploying, and managing low-cost low-powered long-range networks.

			# Build a node!

			Let's build a circuit to connect to the network. You can send a message by pressing the button. Received messages should light up the LED.
