# Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet
_**Workshop Series** by [Toronto Mesh](https://tomesh.net)_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomeshnet/p2p-internet-workshop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomeshnet/p2p-internet-workshop)

## Description

Participants will learn about community networks, wireless mesh networks, distributed applications, and train their pet Raspberry Pi to do networking things. While this course assumes no technical expertise, all sessions contain a technical hands-on component and a reflection activity to explore the role of technologies on our society. A socially-minded tinkerer who enjoys a collaborative learning experience will be the ideal participant.

This course can be facilitated in an environment without internet access. Participants will be expected to bring their own laptop.

**Duration:** 1.5 hours per week for 6 weeks  
**Discussion:** [#p2p-internet-workshop:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#p2p-internet-workshop:tomesh.net)

## Module Topics

1. [What is mesh?](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/module-1/)
1. [Setting up your first node](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/module-2/)
1. [Building nodes (hardware)](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/module-3/)
1. [Planning a network](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/module-4/)
1. [Measuring networks](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/module-5/)
1. [Living on a decentralized network](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/module-6/)

## Learning Outcomes

- Working with Raspberry Pi's to make a network router
- Building mesh networks and running peer-to-peer applications
- Understanding the barriers to access and the history of the internet in Toronto as well as mesh networks worldwide
- Unpacking the values of distributed vs. centralized systems
- Applying network security and private communications
- Starting and maintaining a sustainable community mesh network

## Expectations

- Each participant will have a hardware kit
- Participants will bring their own laptop
- Participants will receive primer information via a [welcome email](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/general/general-welcome-email.pdf), which includes [laptop setup instructions](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/general/general-laptop-setup-instructions.pdf), a Linux shell primer, and a [pre-workshop survey](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/general/general-pre-workshop-survey.pdf)
- Participants are comfortable using a computer before, with no assumptions about prior programming or networking knowledge

## Facilitation Guidelines

- Each module should be presented by a lead facilitator driving the session according to the lesson plan
- Aim to have one helper for every 6 students, responsible for:
    - Providing assistance during hands-on sections
    - Keeping groups on schedule for each activity
    - Having one helper observe the class and providing feedback ([sample reflection questions](http://www.teachhub.com/teaching-strategies-value-self-reflection))
- Use a [shared notepad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/peer-to-peer-internet) for:
    - Sharing notes and links
    - Jargon-busting
- Conclude with a [ticket out the door](http://www.ideasforeducators.com/idea-blog/a-twist-on-ticket-out-the-door) activity where students can optionally and anonymously leave feedback as they leave the class

## Workshop Materials

Class materials are written as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files and presentation slides are created as Markdown-based [Remark slides](https://github.com/gnab/remark). All generated assets are hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/) and packaged as a downloadable archive on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tomeshnet/p2p-internet-workshop/releases/latest).

If you want to generate course assets yourself, simply run `./install-dependencies.sh` and `./build.sh`. You will find the generated assets in the `output` folder. The `./package.sh` script is used to zip up the generated assets into downloadable archives and to create the course website.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is configured to build, package, and publish a new release to GitHub Pages and Releases whenever a new tag is pushed. So all you need to create a new release is to push a new tag with `git tag <version>` and `git push --tag`.

## Credits

The first version of this syllabus is created by [Toronto Mesh](https://tomesh.net) contributors: [@benhylau](https://github.com/benhylau), [@darkdrgn2k](https://github.com/darkdrgn2k), [@dcwalk](https://github.com/dcwalk), [@uditvira](https://github.com/uditvira), [@Shrinks99](https://github.com/Shrinks99), and [@Pedro-on-a-bike](https://github.com/Pedro-on-a-bike). While most of the material is created new, the course also incorporates many prior works listed [here](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/articles/general/general-extra-resources.pdf), or otherwise referenced in their individual course modules.

Hands-on activities rely on software from many projects: [mesh-orange](https://github.com/tomeshnet/mesh-orange), [mesh-router-builder](https://github.com/benhylau/mesh-router-builder), [mesh-workshop](https://github.com/benhylau/mesh-workshop/), [steamlink](https://github.com/steamlink), [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/), [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc/). Course material generation uses [markdown-pdf](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf) and [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape). The course website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the theme is from [Mozilla's Open Leadership Training Series](https://github.com/mozilla/open-leadership-training-series). Icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Jake Ingman](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=mesh&i=74809) are used.
