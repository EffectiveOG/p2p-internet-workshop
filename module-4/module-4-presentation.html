			# Module 4: Planning a network

			1. Recap from last week
			2. Network deployment planning
			3. Mapping the Fort York Micro Mesh
			4. Connecting technical and outreach strategies
			5. Wrap-up & homework

			---

			# Recap from last week

			Using .highlight[Raspberry Pis], we formed a .highlight[wireless mesh network] (week 1), we then learned more about .highlight[networks and the internet] (week 2), and .highlight[configuring wireless mesh networks] (week 3).

			_This week we will start to think about scale and putting these networks out into the wild._

			# Network deployment planning

			 Goals, site evaluation, and important considerations for creating a network!

			---

			# Identify goals

			###Key questions:

			- How will the network be used? What will it accomplish?
			  - Detail specific applications or "use cases" (helps understand capacity)
			- In one area, how many people do you expect to be on the network? (helps understand link speed "budget", select hardware)
			  - Assessment based on surveying needs
			  - Calculations using link planning software (e.g. RadioMobile)
			  - Trial and error!
			- _Others?_

			---

			# Evaluate potential sites

			- **Wireless Networking Potential**, including tallest buildings, line of sight, obstructions (e.g. hills, trees and more), interference (i.e. other installations of wireless equipment (Resources: [Wireless Networking in the Developing World](http://wndw.net/))
			- **Mounting and Power Options**, including where and how can power be provided? Roofs access and safety? Windows or tinted glass?
			- **Social Opportunities and Challenges**, important locations, active members, local businesses, owners, willingness? (Resources: [Commotion Wireless Construction Kit](https://commotionwireless.net/docs))

			---

			# Important factors while planning

			- Antenna types and characteristics
			  - Transmit (TX) Power (dBm)
			  - Gain (amplification based on shape)
			  - Sensitivity or Received Signal Level (RSL)
			  - Loss (distance, cable connections), attenuation (passing through objects), and scattering (dispersal)
			- Noise and obstructions

			# Mapping the Fort York Micro Mesh

			## Connecting technical & outreach strategies

			Let's look at [Commotion Construction Kit](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/)'s other resources:
			  - [Survey your Neighbors](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/survey-your-neighbors/)
			  - [Identify Neighbourhood Skills](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/identify-neighborhood-skills/)
			  - [Inventory your Neighbourhood](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/inventory-the-neighborhood/)

			# Wrap-up & Homework

			---

			# Recap

			- Discussed considerations for planning and deploying a network
			- Went outside (hopefully)!
			- Brainstormed how that might apply in Toronto

			_Questions?_

			---

			# Homework

			Next session we will discuss Measuring a Network as well as Net Neutrality.

			üìù _Watch these videos on Net Neutrality!_

			- [Net Neutrality - 6 Minute Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zASHI9qdB0U) by drawntoknowledge _(Note: This video incorrectly labels ISPs as Tier 1 providers_
			- ["The Internet We Want" Panel starting @ 27:00](https://youtu.be/PtO4rPPBWjY?t=27m00s) hosted by Logic Magazine and NYC DSA Tech Action committee

			_Optionally:_

			- Read "[A plan to rescue the Web from the Internet](https://staltz.com/a-plan-to-rescue-the-web-from-the-internet.html)" by Andrew Staltz
